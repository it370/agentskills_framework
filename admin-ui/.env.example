# API and WebSocket configuration
# The protocol and domain are automatically determined based on the page URL:
# - localhost or 127.x.x.x -> http://domain:port and ws://domain:port
# - production domain or other IPs -> https://domain:port and wss://domain:port

# Port configuration (required)

# - Can also include full URL with protocol (e.g., "https://api.example.com")
